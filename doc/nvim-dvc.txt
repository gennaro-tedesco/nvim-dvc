==============================================================================
1. INTRODUCTION				*dvc-introduction*

*nvim-dvc* is the neovim interface to dvc: dvc: https://dvc.org/
It allows to

- populate the location list with dvc stages for easy lookup and navigation
- populate the location list with dvc metrics file for quick access to models evaluations
- autocomplete and execute dvc stages from within neovim
- access dvc configurations quickly

`nvim-dvc` makes use of command line core utils and `jq` (to parse dvc outputs), therefore
it is recommended that you have them installed.

==============================================================================
2. USAGE				*dvc-usage*
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

`nvim-dvc` exposes the following commands to the user:

  - DVCStages
  - DVCMetrics
  - DVCRepro
  - DVCFiles
  - DVCConfig

  DVCStages       *DVCStages*

  Executing `DVCStages` on any file in a git+dvc repository opens up
  the corresponding `dvc.yaml` file (if it exists), populating the location
  list with the pipeline stages. If the project is not a git repository or the
  yaml file does not exists, an error message is displayed.

  `DVCStages` also displays autocompletion: hitting `<Tab>` shows a prompt
  with all the dvc stages and allows to directly move to the selected one instead
  of populating the location list, thereby making navigation much quicker in
  case the stage to check is already known.


  DVCMetrics       *DVCMetrics*

  Executing `DVCMetrics` populates the location list with metrics files for
  quick access.

<
  DVCRepro         *DVCRepro*

  `DVCRepro` enables tab completion for dvc stages in the command prompt. Use
  it as `DVCRepro <TAB>` to see the list of available stages to execute:
  notice that additional flags can be provided and the strings are passed
  directly to the shell to be executed (so any valid dvc command flag would
  work).


  DVCFiles         *DVCFiles*

  Executing `DVCFiles` populates the location list with dvc-tracked files for
  quick access.


==============================================================================
3. CUSTOMISATION        *dvc-customisation*

  You can choose whether to populate the location list (default) or the
  quickfix list instead. Simply override the configuration setting
  `lua require('nvim-dvc.config').use_quickfix = true`

4. SEE ALSO
